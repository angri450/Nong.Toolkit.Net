# Inspect

Use `nong inspect` for paper-level semantic, structural, evidence, reference, and writing workflows. Inspect consumes text or paper specs; for `.docx` sources, use `word dissect` or `word read` first. For external literature metadata/OA retrieval, use the `literature` skill and `nong lit`; `inspect refs` is an internal reference-list and citation-risk check, not a database search.

## Nong CLI Preflight

Read [../references/shared/nong-cli-preflight.md](../references/shared/nong-cli-preflight.md) before the first Nong command in a session. Confirm Nong.Cli.Net `4.0.0+` and the needed command group.
## Implemented Commands

Current `nong commands --json` exposes these 11 implemented Inspect commands:

```powershell
nong inspect diagnose <paper.txt> --json
nong inspect refs <paper.txt> --json
nong inspect write-paper <spec.json> -o <out.docx> --json
nong inspect write-official <spec.json> -o <out.docx> --json
nong inspect classify <paper.txt> --json
nong inspect structure <paper.txt> --json
nong inspect varplan <paper.txt> --json
nong inspect evidence <paper.txt> --json
nong inspect data-req <paper.txt> --json
nong inspect gap <paper.txt> --json
nong inspect semantics <paper.txt> --json
```

## Dispatch

For input preparation, focused diagnostics, and writing handoff, read [references/paper-diagnostics.md](references/paper-diagnostics.md).

1. For `.docx` papers, run `nong word dissect <file.docx> --output <slice-dir> --json` and use `<slice-dir>/content.nongmark` as the inspect input. Use `nong word read <file.docx> --json` only for quick plain-text extraction.
2. For full paper quality diagnosis, run `nong inspect diagnose <paper.txt> --json`.
3. For references and citation risk, run `nong inspect refs <paper.txt> --json`.
4. For paper type routing, run `nong inspect classify <paper.txt> --json`.
5. For title, abstract, keywords, section, table, and reference extraction, run `nong inspect structure <paper.txt> --json`.
6. For variable operationalization and data collection planning, run `nong inspect varplan <paper.txt> --json`.
7. For evidence chain checks, run `nong inspect evidence <paper.txt> --json`.
8. For data source, sample, measurement, and method-data fit checks, run `nong inspect data-req <paper.txt> --json`.
9. For empirical paper gap grading, run `nong inspect gap <paper.txt> --json`.
10. For research design semantics, causal wording, mechanism claims, and method alignment, run `nong inspect semantics <paper.txt> --json`.
11. For official-document gongwen format compliance audit, run `nong inspect official-check <file.docx> --json`. Checks red header, doc number, title, recipient, body, closing, signature, and date against gongwen formatting rules.
11. For a Word paper draft, prepare a paper spec JSON and run `nong inspect write-paper <spec.json> -o <out.docx> --json`; then use Word commands for DOCX validation and slicing.
12. For an official-document draft, prepare an official spec JSON and run `nong inspect write-official <spec.json> -o <out.docx> --json`; then validate/slice with the Word skill. For formatting an existing DOCX into gongwen style, use `nong word format-gongwen`.

Inspect is not a DOCX parser. Keep Word layout, assets, comments, revisions, validation, and append edits in the `word` skill.

## Paper Spec

Use this minimal shape for `write-paper`:

```json
{
  "title": "Title",
  "abstract": "Abstract text.",
  "keywords": "keyword1; keyword2",
  "sections": [
    {
      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "level": 1,
      "body": ["Paragraph one.", "Paragraph two."]
    }
  ],
  "references": ["[1] Author. Title. Journal, 2026."]
}
```

`sections[].heading` is required. `level` must be 1-3. Treat `E006 validation_failed` as a spec problem.

## Official-Document Spec

Use this minimal shape for `write-official`:

```json
{
  "redHeader": "Demo Agency File",
  "docNumber": "Demo [2026] 1",
  "title": "Demo Notice",
  "recipient": "All units:",
  "body": ["Paragraph one.", "Paragraph two."],
  "closing": "This is the notice.",
  "signature": "Demo Agency",
  "date": "2026-06-10"
}
```

`title` is required. `body` may be a string or an array of strings. Treat `E006 validation_failed` as a spec problem.

## Contract

Always use `--json` when the result will feed another tool or model decision. Treat `status: "error"` as failed.

Reference and semantic outputs are rule-based writing and method diagnostics. Do not present them as external database verification, advisor review, or peer review. Use `nong lit` when the task requires OpenAlex/Crossref/Unpaywall metadata, DOI lookup, or reference export.
